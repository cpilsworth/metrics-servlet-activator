Simple project to OSGify the [Metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com/) library and register the servlets with using the [OSGi HTTP Whiteboard](http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html#ApacheFelixHTTPService-UsingtheWhiteboard)

Currently, this project embeds the metrics and jackson dependencies.  These should be split out at some point.
